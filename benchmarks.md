## Manual Annotation Instructions

### Verified Status
Each model variant can be individually annotated with "Yes", "No", or "Unknown" based on manual
inspection of the converted USD files. Update the annotations in the `tools/menagerie_annotations.yaml`
file under each variant's `verified` field.

**Consider these factors:**
- Visual correctness when loaded in USD viewer
- Proper hierarchy and naming
- Material and texture fidelity
- Physics properties preservation
- Simulation correctness in MuJoCo Simulate compared to the original MJCF file

### Notes
Document any known issues, limitations, or special considerations for each model variant in the
`notes` field under each variant in the annotations file.

### Annotation Structure
Annotations are per-variant rather than per-asset. Each XML file listed under an asset's
`xml_files` array has its own `verified`, `notes`, `evaluation_date`, `evaluator`, and `notes` fields.

### File Size Information
**Total Size:** Overall size of all files in the output directory, including USD files, textures,
and any other generated assets.
